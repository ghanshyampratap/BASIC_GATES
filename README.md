# BASIC-GATES ⚙️  
**Simulation and Layout Implementation of Basic Logic Gates in 180nm CMOS Technology**


## 📋 Overview  
Welcome to the **BASIC-GATES** repository!  
This project contains the **design, simulation, and layout** files for essential logic gates implemented in **180nm CMOS process technology** using **Cadence Virtuoso**.  

The gates include:  
- AND Gate  
- OR Gate  
- NAND Gate  
- NOR Gate  
- Inverter (NOT)  

This repo serves as a hands-on learning resource for students and engineers exploring **transistor-level digital design**, **layouts**, and **verifications**.


## 🛠️ Gates Included  

Each logic gate includes:  

- ✅ **Schematic capture (Cadence Virtuoso)**  
- ✅ **Symbolic representation**  
- ✅ **Layout design (Virtuoso Layout Editor)**  
- ✅ **Simulation results (ADE / Spectre)**  
- ✅ **Layout vs Schematic (LVS) verification**  


## 💡 Technology  

- Designed and verified in **180nm CMOS process technology**  
- Implemented and simulated using **Cadence Virtuoso EDA Tool Suite**  
- Suitable for **digital design learning & prototyping**  
- Demonstrates **layout vs schematic (LVS)** matching  



## 👩‍💻 How to Use  

1. Open **schematics (Virtuoso Schematic Editor)** to study transistor-level designs.  
2. Explore **layouts (Virtuoso Layout Editor)** to see physical implementations.  
3. Run **simulations (ADE / Spectre)** to confirm logical behavior.  
4. Check **LVS results (Assura/Calibre)** to verify schematic ↔ layout consistency.  



## 🎯 Goals  

- Provide **practical examples** of digital VLSI gate design.  
- Help students and engineers learn **process-oriented design & verification**.  
- Act as a reference for **educational VLSI projects**.
